# 100_Days_of_Python

Course: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Day 1: A bit of a drag, but it's trying to explain things for someone who doesn't know code. If I wasn't a bit of a completionist, I would have skipped this one. I do like how easy the terminal input is in Python.

Day 2: From what I heard about Python I was suprized it was more picky about data types then JavaScript. As this str + int doesn't work in Python.

> Attempt 1: I didn't think the assiment would care about rounding, so I didn't. After I realized it did when they were showing the video just before shwoing me how to do it, I change my code to do that.
> Attempt 2: I thought it would care at this point about print 5.5 as 5.50, so my code did that. Looks like I want in the other direction in what I thought it wanted.
