# 100_Days_of_Python

Course: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Day 1: A bit of a drag, but it's trying to explain things for someone who doesn't know code. If I wasn't a bit of a completionist, I would have skipped this one. I do like how easy the terminal input is in Python.

Day 2: From what I heard about Python I was suprized it was more picky about data types then JavaScript. As this str + int doesn't work in Python.

> Attempt 1: I didn't think the assiment would care about rounding, so I didn't. After I realized it did when they were showing the video just before shwoing me how to do it, I change my code to do that.
> Attempt 2: I thought it would care at this point about print 5.5 as 5.50, so my code did that. Looks like I want in the other direction in what I thought it wanted.

Day 3: If statment based game. Copyed the text from domo. Saw lecture, it instructed to lowercase the user input, so I changed that. I did learn I can split my input str in do multiple lines to make it more readable.

Day 4: random.choice(list) function is cool.

Day 5: Change my code after seeing theirs to use random.shuffle(list)

Day 6: I did the challenage on the site they gave because I wanted to know if my idea for the advance code would work. I do like my answer better.

Day 7:

1. I don't have the list of words they gave so I just assigned one, and didn't make a file with a bunch of words.
2. I didn't have all the hangan img (The demo game wasn't displaying it correctly, but I probably should set up to display ,image in the array with it matching the lives the user has.)
3. I wish I didn't try to copy the text and making work the same as the demo. But it matchs in function even if it's implemented differently.

Day 8:

> I addes support for capatazed letters. (Demo didn't.)
> Personalized messages based what if you were encrypting or decrypting
> I learned to checked user input and have it handle wrong inputs. (Not learned that yet in this program.)

Day 9:

1. Nothing note worthy.

Day 10:

1. I added % to the program
2. I added a option to end the program. I didn't like it went forever in the demo.
3. I did like how I implemented the other to options of starting over or continuing with the last number.
4. I change my code to add the trick with dict. Very nice.

Day 11:

1. I used a card list to make it more realistic.
2. I used A, K, Q, and J cards and not just display 10 or 11 for those. This was more work to count the score, but it was well worth it.
3. I displayed the cards wihout it showing an array format when it printed to the screen. Looks better.
4. I displayed the computers faced down cards as []. So the player/user can see how many cards the computer took. As you would in a real game.
5. I changed the way it displays with printing new lines to help it be more readable.
6. I did have to go back and add the black jack win rule. I had already learned how the video solved that. So I don't know how I would have done it.

Day 12: I learned python is not block scoped.
